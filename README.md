# Multifunction Digital clock using AVR
A mini-project as part of Microcontroller and Applications course. (Aug 2018 - Oct 2018)
 - Developed project along with individual libraries of LCD, I2C and DS1307 in Atmel Studio using Embedded C. The clock had alarm, timer and stopwatch functions.
 - Components used were 20x4 LCD, push-buttons, DS1307(RTC), Atmega32 and buzzer. The project was simulated in Proteus.
